## ðŸŽ“ Key Learnings & Best Practices

### Development Best Practices

1. **Start with Database Schema**
   - Design database first before coding
   - Ensures all relationships are correct
   - Prevents costly refactoring later

2. **Test with Real Data Early**
   - Create seed data with realistic referral chains
   - Test edge cases (e.g., 3-level upline limit)
   - Catch bugs before production

3. **Mobile-First Design**
   - Most users will access on mobile
   - Test on real devices, not just browser emulators
   - Ensure QR scanning works on iOS Safari

4. **Iterate Based on Feedback**
   - Don't assume you know what users want
   - Collect feedback early and often
   - Be willing to pivot if needed

5. **Monitor from Day 1**
   - Setup analytics and error tracking immediately
   - Catch issues before they become critical
   - Use data to make decisions

### Project Management Best Practices

1. **Daily Standups**
   - Keep team aligned
   - Surface blockers early
   - 15 minutes max

2. **Weekly Reviews**
   - Demo progress to stakeholders
   - Celebrate wins
   - Adjust plan if needed

3. **Clear Acceptance Criteria**
   - Every user story has clear "done" definition
   - Prevents scope creep
   - Enables faster QA

4. **Buffer Time**
   - Plan for 20% buffer (unexpected bugs, delays)
   - Don't over-commit on features
   - Better to under-promise and over-deliver
