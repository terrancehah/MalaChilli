### Restaurant-Specific Promotion Cards
Minimal restaurant cards displaying individual VC balance, visit tracking, and share functionality. Each restaurant maintains its own separate VC balance to prevent cross-restaurant exploitation. Currency earned at one restaurant can only be redeemed at that restaurant, ensuring fair distribution.
